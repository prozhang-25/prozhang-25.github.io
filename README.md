Welcome to my personal website!

## About Me

Hello, I'm **Pro Zhang**.

I am an explorer with a deep curiosity for the economic world, particularly fascinated by the dynamics and logic of macro-finance. I created this space to document and share my thoughts on economic theories, my analysis of market phenomena, and the "interesting ideas" that often cross my mind.

I believe that economics is not just an abstract discipline confined to academia; it is deeply intertwined with our daily lives. Here, I aim to explore the ebb and flow of financial markets and the pulse of the macroeconomy with a clear and engaging perspective.
