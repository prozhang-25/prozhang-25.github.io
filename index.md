# Welcome to my personal website!

## About Me

Hello, I'm **Punuo Zhang**. (The pronunciation of my first name is like "Pro", so you can call me Pro, though I am not a pro in any sense.)

I am a junior at Fudan University. My major is Mathematical Economics (which in fact has nothing to do with maths...). My current research interest (perhaps call it "study interest" would be more appropriate) lies in Macro-finance, a combination of Macroeconomics, Finance, Asset Pricing, Game Theory, and a little about Political Economy. I believe these seemingly uncorelated fields have some intrinsic dependence on each other.
