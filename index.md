# About Me

Hello, I'm **Punuo Zhang**. (The pronunciation of my first name is like "Pro", so you can call me Pro, though I am not a pro in any sense.)

I am a junior at Fudan University. My major is Mathematial Economics (which in fact has nothing to do with maths...). My current research interest (perhaps call it "study interest" would be more appropriate) lies in Macro-finance, a combination of Macroeconomics, Finance, Asset Pricing, Game Theory, and a little about Political Economy. I believe these seemingly uncorrelated fields have some intrinsic dependence on each other.

# Yapping

In my opinion, there are two kinds of economic research which fascinates me most: i) those develop a model or a theory to capture the essential nature of our society, and ii) those reveal fundamental facts about our society. Stories are good, intuitions would be better, but please show me your model!

Here is my favorite quote:

**The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.**

Robert Lucas, Jr., *On the Machanics of Economic Development*

# What to Expect on this Website

This site primarily revolves around the following topics:

* **1. Lecture Notes** that I think is useful. (Some of them may be written by Gemini / Claude!)
* **2. My Thinking** on some economic theories and phenomena. All articles in this part are written by myself (and thus, may have significantly more mistakes than the first part...). I try to reinterprete some important theories / facts in my own words, if I believe my interpretion is new / more intuitive / interesting. Comments and arguments are welcome!
* **3. Beautiful Photos** I took all over the world. Leave Economics away, GUYS, THIS IS OUR BEAUTIFUL LIFE!
